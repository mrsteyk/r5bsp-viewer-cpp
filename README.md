I just lost all will to continue this project so here we go, feel free to fork...

A bit more info: this repo is like a few weeks old, I wanted to perfect the BSP loading so people could have a tool to snoop aroun maps without having to load them into blender which will consume 9001 gigs of RAM cuz editing stuff, but I never got around to finishing even the proper texture loading and mesh handling, and recently Porter added it to his own tool, so this all just became useless. But originally this was supposed to be my `OGL4.6 core` playground...
